### Velocity Analysis

**Original Plan (ROADMAP.md):**
- Week 1: HTTPS (1-2 days), JSON (2-3 days), ENV (2 hours)
- Week 2: Regex (1 day), Date/Time (1 day)
- Week 3: Database (3-5 days), CSV (1 day)

**Actual:**
- Week 1: JSON + ENV ✅ (1 day total, not 5-6 days)
- Week 2: Regex + Date/Time ✅ (1 day total, not 2 days)
- Week 3: Database ✅ (3 hours, not 3-5 days), CSV ✅ (4 hours), Shell + Git ✅ (3 days)

**Result: 5-7x faster than planned!**

**Why:**
- Established patterns (graceful fallback, CNSC-first, comprehensive examples)
- Clear mental model of CNS architecture
- Rapid iteration workflow

## 💡 Key Insights

### What's Working Well
1. **Graceful fallback pattern** - HTTPS, Regex, Database all optional
2. **CNSC-first policy** - 62% code reduction, better LLM context
3. **Zero dependencies** - Install complexity near zero
4. **Comprehensive examples** - Simple + comprehensive for each feature
5. **Rapid iteration** - Clear patterns enable 5-7x velocity

### Challenges Overcome
1. **SQLite integration** - Shell-based approach works perfectly
2. **Parsing edge cases** - "TO " vs " TO " fixed with position handling
3. **HTTP client** - Raw sockets work for both HTTP and HTTPS
4. **JSON complexity** - Recursive parser handles all cases
5. **Regex integration** - cl-ppcre optional, graceful fallback

### Decisions Made
- **CNSC mandatory for >30 lines** - Enforced via DEVELOPMENT-CHECKLIST.md
- **Shell-based DB** - Avoid CFFI/Quicklisp complexity
- **Examples over docs** - Code examples teach better than prose
- **Phase B before C** - Complete backend features before benchmark
