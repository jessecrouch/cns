# Session Summary: Webserver String Handling Fixes

**Date:** 2025-10-27  
**Commit:** 2e66547

## Problems Solved

### 1. CSS Variable Substitution Conflict
**Issue:** The `substitute-vars` function was replacing ALL `{...}` patterns, including CSS syntax like `body{font-family:Arial}`, resulting in CSS showing `bodyNIL` instead of proper braces.

**Solution:** 
- Extended `extract-quoted-string` to preserve `\{` and `\}` as escape sequences
- Modified `substitute-vars` to convert `\{` → `{` and `\}` → `}` after variable substitution
- CNS files can now use `body\{font-family:Arial\}` which renders as `body{font-family:Arial}`

### 2. Quoted HTML Attributes Truncation
**Issue:** Strings with embedded quotes like `<div class=\"box\">` were being truncated at the first embedded quote, breaking HTML output.

**Root Cause:** Parser was calling `extract-quoted-string` during parsing, converting `\"` to `"`. Then the interpreter extracted again, stopping at the unescaped quote.

**Solution:**
- Removed quote extraction from parser (Effect nodes now store raw strings)
- Let `apply-effect` handle extraction at runtime
- Single extraction pass preserves escape sequences correctly

### 3. String Literal Evaluation Bug
**Issue:** String literals like `"test"` in Given sections were being evaluated as variable names, resulting in `NIL`.

**Solution:** Reordered `eval-expr` to check for string literals (starts with `"`) BEFORE attempting variable lookup.

### 4. Multiline String Support
**Enhancement:** Full support for escape sequences in multiline strings:
- `\r\n` → HTTP headers
- `\t` → tabs
- `\"` → embedded quotes
- `\\` → literal backslash
- `\{` and `\}` → literal braces (for CSS)

## Demonstration

**Working Demo:** `examples/demo-webserver.cns`

```bash
./cns-run examples/demo-webserver.cns
curl http://localhost:8080/
```

**Output:** Properly styled HTML page with:
- ✅ CSS styling with braces
- ✅ Quoted HTML attributes (`class="box"`)
- ✅ Variable substitution (`Port: 8080 | Connections: 3`)
- ✅ Persistent connection counter across requests
- ✅ HTTP headers with `\r\n` escape sequences

## Technical Details

**Key Functions Modified:**
- `extract-quoted-string` (new): Handles all escape sequences including `\{` and `\}`
- `substitute-vars`: Added placeholders for escaped braces
- `eval-expr`: Reordered condition checks
- Parser: Simplified Effect clause handling
- `socket-send`: Changed from `force-output` to `finish-output`

**Files Changed:**
- `cns.lisp`: +226 lines (including new function)
- `examples/demo-webserver.cns`: New file (45 lines)

## Next Steps

Recommended from UPDATES.md roadmap:
- **Phase 4, Task 9-10:** Testing & validation (build test suite)
- **Phase 4, Task 11-12:** Unsupervised robustness (Docker sandbox, self-correction)
- **Production enhancements:** Route handling, POST data, static files, threading, HTTPS

## Testing

All functionality verified:
```bash
# Test escape sequences
echo 'Effect: Print "CSS: body\{color:red\}"' # Works
echo 'Effect: Print "Quote: \" works"'         # Works

# Test webserver
./cns-run examples/demo-webserver.cns
curl http://localhost:8080/  # Returns full styled HTML (661 bytes)
```
