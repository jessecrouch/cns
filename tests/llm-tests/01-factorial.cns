Story: Calculate factorial of 5

Given:
  n: Integer = 5
  result: Integer = 1

Step 1 → Multiply result by n
  Because: n contributes to the factorial product
  Then: n becomes n - 1

Step 2 → If n > 1
  Because: We need to multiply all integers down to 1
  Then: repeat from Step 1
  Otherwise: go to End

End: Return result
