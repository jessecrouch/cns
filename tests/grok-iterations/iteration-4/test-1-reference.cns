Story: Word Counter CLI Tool

Given:
  filename: String = ARGS[0]
  show_lines: Boolean = HAS_FLAG("--lines")
  show_chars: Boolean = HAS_FLAG("--chars")
  verbose: Boolean = HAS_FLAG("--verbose")
  file_exists: Boolean = FALSE
  content: String = ""
  lines: List = []
  words: List = []
  count: Integer = 0
  output: String = ""

Step 1 → Validate filename provided
  Because: User must provide a filename
  If: filename = ""
    Effect: Print "Error: No filename provided"
    Then: go to End

Step 2 → Check if file exists
  Because: Cannot count words in non-existent file
  Then: file_exists becomes FILE EXISTS filename
  If: NOT file_exists
    Effect: Print "Error: File not found"
    Then: go to End

Step 3 → Read file content
  Because: Need content to count
  Then: content becomes READ FROM FILE filename

Step 4 → Determine what to count
  Because: Handle different flag options
  If: show_lines
    Then: go to Step 10
  Otherwise:
    Then: go to Step 5

Step 5 → Check if counting characters
  Because: Different counting methods
  If: show_chars
    Then: go to Step 20
  Otherwise:
    Then: go to Step 30

Step 10 → Count lines
  Because: User requested line count
  Then: lines becomes SPLIT content BY "\n"
  Then: count becomes LENGTH OF lines
  Then: go to Step 40

Step 20 → Count characters
  Because: User requested character count
  Then: count becomes LENGTH OF content
  Then: go to Step 40

Step 30 → Count words (default)
  Because: Default behavior is word count
  Then: words becomes SPLIT content BY " "
  Then: count becomes LENGTH OF words
  Then: go to Step 40

Step 40 → Format output
  Because: Prepare final output message
  If: verbose
    Then: go to Step 50
  Otherwise:
    Then: go to Step 60

Step 50 → Verbose output with filename
  Because: User wants filename in output
  If: show_lines
    Then: output becomes filename + ": " + count + " lines"
  Otherwise:
    Then: go to Step 51

Step 51 → Check chars for verbose
  Because: Different label for different counts
  If: show_chars
    Then: output becomes filename + ": " + count + " chars"
  Otherwise:
    Then: output becomes filename + ": " + count + " words"
  Then: go to Step 70

Step 60 → Simple output (just number)
  Because: No verbose flag, just show count
  Then: output becomes count

Step 70 → Print result
  Because: Display the final count
  Effect: Print output

End: Return 0
