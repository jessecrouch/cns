Story: Determine if a given integer greater than or equal to 2 is a prime number

Given:
  num: Integer [≥ 2] = 17
  is_prime: Boolean = True
  i: Integer = 2

Step 1 → If i * i > num
  Because: All potential factors up to sqrt(num) have been checked
  Then: go to End
  Otherwise: go to Step 2

Step 2 → If num % i == 0
  Because: i is a divisor, so num is not prime
  Then: is_prime becomes False
       go to End
  Otherwise: go to Step 3

Step 3 → Increment i by 1
  Because: Move to the next potential factor
  Then: i becomes i + 1
       repeat from Step 1

Error:
  Return False
  Effect: none
  Because: Handle case where num < 2 although assumed valid

End: Return is_prime
