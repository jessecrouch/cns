Story: Determine if a given integer is a prime number

Given:
  num: Integer = 15
  is_prime: Boolean = TRUE
  i: Integer = 2

Step 1 → If i * i > num
  Because: All potential factors up to sqrt(num) have been checked
  Then: go to End
  Otherwise: go to Step 2

Step 2 → If num % i = 0
  Because: i is a divisor, so num is not prime
  Then: is_prime becomes FALSE
  Otherwise: go to Step 3

Step 3 → If is_prime = FALSE
  Because: Already determined num is not prime
  Then: go to End
  Otherwise: go to Step 4

Step 4 → Increment i by 1
  Because: Move to the next potential factor
  Then: i becomes i + 1
  Then: repeat from Step 1

End: Return is_prime
