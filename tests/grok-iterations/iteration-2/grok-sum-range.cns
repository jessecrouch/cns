Story: Compute the sum of all integers from 1 to a given number n

Given:
  n: Integer = 10
  total_sum: Integer = 0
  current: Integer = 1

Step 1 → Add current to total_sum
  Because: Each integer from 1 to n must be accumulated in the sum
  Then: total_sum becomes total_sum + current

Step 2 → Increment current by 1
  Because: Prepare to add the next integer in the sequence
  Then: current becomes current + 1

Step 3 → If current <= n
  Because: Continue the summation until all integers are included
  Then: repeat from Step 1
  Otherwise: go to End

End: Return total_sum
