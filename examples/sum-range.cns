Story: Sum all integers from start to end

Given:
  start: Integer = 1
  end: Integer = 100
  current: Integer = 1
  sum: Integer = 0

Step 1 → sum becomes sum + current
  Because: accumulate the current value into the sum

Step 2 → current becomes current + 1
  Because: move to the next integer in the range

Step 3 → If current < end
  Because: check if we've reached the end of the range
  Then: repeat from Step 1
  Otherwise: go to End

End: Return sum
