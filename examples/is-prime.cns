Story: Check if a number is prime by trial division

Given:
  n: Integer = 17
  divisor: Integer = 2
  is-prime: Integer = 1

Step 1 → If divisor * divisor > n
  Because: only need to check up to square root of n
  Then: go to End
  Otherwise: go to End

Step 2 → divisor becomes divisor + 1
  Because: check the next potential divisor

Step 3 → If divisor * divisor < n
  Because: continue checking divisors up to square root
  Then: repeat from Step 1
  Otherwise: go to End

End: Return is-prime
