Story: Count from 1 to 5

Given:
  counter: Integer = 1
  target: Integer = 5

Step 1 → If counter < target
  Because: we haven't reached the target yet
  Then: counter becomes counter + 1
  Otherwise: go to End

Step 2 → If counter < target
  Because: check if we need to continue
  Then: repeat from Step 1
  Otherwise: go to End

End: Return counter
