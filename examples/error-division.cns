Story: Demonstrate error handling with division by zero

Given:
  a: Integer = 100
  b: Integer = 0
  result: Integer

Step 1 → Attempt division
  Because: Calculate a / b
  Then: result becomes a / b

Step 2 → Display result
  Because: Show the calculation
  Effect: Print "Result: {result}"

End: Return result

Error:
  Return -1
  Effect: Print "Error: Cannot divide by zero"
  Because: Division by zero is undefined
