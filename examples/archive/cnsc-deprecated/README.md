# CNSC Deprecated Files

These files use the CNS Compact (CNSC) syntax, which has been deprecated in favor of the more LLM-friendly full CNS syntax.

**Reason for deprecation:**
- Maintaining two syntaxes added unnecessary complexity
- CNSC's terse notation reduced readability without significant benefit
- LLMs perform better with explicit, verbose syntax
- Parser complexity reduced by ~300 lines
