Story: Test Enhanced JSON Parser Direct
  Narrative: Test JSON parsing with simple flat JSON first

Given:
  json: String = "{\"name\":\"Bob\",\"age\":25}"
  name: String = ""
  age: Integer = 0

Step 1 → Parse name from JSON
  Because: Extract name field from JSON
  Then: name becomes PARSE JSON json GET "name"

Step 2 → Parse age from JSON  
  Because: Extract age field from JSON
  Then: age becomes PARSE JSON json GET "age"

Step 3 → Display results
  Effect: PRINT "Parsed: {name}, age {age}"
  
  Because: Show what we extracted

End:
  Outcome: JSON parsing successful
  Result: name and age extracted correctly
