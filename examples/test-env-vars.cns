Story: Test Environment Variables
  Narrative: Verify that ENV() function works with and without defaults

Given:
  api_key: String = ""
  user_name: String = ""
  port: String = ""
  missing_var: String = ""

Step 1 → Get API key from environment
  Because: Test ENV with actual environment variable
  Then: api_key becomes ENV("TEST_API_KEY", "default_key_123")

Step 2 → Get username from environment
  Because: Test ENV with another variable  
  Then: user_name becomes ENV("USER", "unknown_user")

Step 3 → Get port with default
  Because: Test ENV with likely missing variable and default
  Then: port becomes ENV("APP_PORT", "8080")

Step 4 → Get missing variable without default
  Because: Test ENV with no default (should return empty string)
  Then: missing_var becomes ENV("NONEXISTENT_VAR")

Step 5 → Display all values
  Because: Show what was retrieved
  Effect: PRINT "API Key: {api_key}"
  Effect: PRINT "User: {user_name}"
  Effect: PRINT "Port: {port}"
  Effect: PRINT "Missing: '{missing_var}'"

End:
  Outcome: Environment variables retrieved successfully
  Result: All ENV() calls completed
