Story: A simple greeting program
# STARTER - Basic CNS example showing loops and counting

Given:
  greetings: Integer = 3
  count: Integer = 0

Step 1 → count becomes count + 1
  Because: we want to count our greetings

Step 2 → If count < greetings
  Because: we should greet multiple times
  Then: repeat from Step 1
  Otherwise: go to End

End: Return count
