Story: Check if a number is even using modulo operator

Given:
  n: Integer = 42
  remainder: Integer = 0
  is_even: Integer = 0

Step 1 → Calculate remainder when dividing n by 2
  Because: even numbers have remainder 0 when divided by 2
  Then: remainder becomes n % 2

Step 2 → If remainder = 0
  Because: remainder of 0 means the number is even
  Then: is_even becomes 1
  Otherwise: go to End

End: Return is_even
