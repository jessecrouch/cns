Story: Count steps in the Collatz conjecture sequence

Given:
  n: Integer = 27
  steps: Integer = 0

Step 1 → If n > 1
  Because: the sequence continues until we reach 1
  Then: steps becomes steps + 1
  Otherwise: go to End

Step 2 → If n > 1
  Because: still need to continue the sequence
  Then: repeat from Step 1
  Otherwise: go to End

End: Return steps
