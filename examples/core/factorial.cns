Story: Compute factorial of a positive integer
# STARTER - Simple math example showing loops and conditionals

Given:
  n: Integer = 5
  result: Integer = 1

Step 1 → Check if done
  Because: we need to multiply all integers from n down to 1
  If: n > 0
    Then: result becomes result * n
    Then: n becomes n - 1
    Then: repeat from Step 1
  Otherwise:
    Then: go to End

End: Return result
