Story: Test HTTPS Support
  Narrative: Verify that CNS can make HTTPS requests to secure APIs

Given:
  - api_url is String with value "https://api.github.com/zen"
  - response_body is String (empty initially)
  - status is Integer (zero initially)

Step 1 → Make HTTPS GET request to GitHub API
  Effect: HTTP GET from api_url into response_body
  Then:
    status becomes 200
  
  Because: GitHub API returns a random Zen quote over HTTPS

Step 2 → Display the response
  Effect: PRINT "GitHub Zen: {response_body}"
  
  Because: We want to see the API response

End:
  Outcome: Successfully retrieved data via HTTPS
  Result: response_body contains GitHub Zen quote
