Story: Test CSV Operations

Given:
  headers: List = ["name", "age", "city"]
  data: List = []
  output_file: String = "test-output.csv"

Step 1 → Create sample data
  Because: building test data as list of lists
  Then: row1 becomes ["Alice", "30", "NYC"]
  Then: row2 becomes ["Bob", "25", "LA"]
  Then: row3 becomes ["Charlie", "35", "Chicago"]
  Effect: ADD row1 TO LIST data
  Effect: ADD row2 TO LIST data
  Effect: ADD row3 TO LIST data

Step 2 → Write CSV file
  Because: testing CSV WRITE functionality
  Effect: CSV WRITE data TO output_file WITH HEADERS headers

Step 3 → Read CSV file back
  Because: testing CSV READ functionality
  Then: loaded_data becomes CSV READ output_file

Step 4 → Display results
  Because: verify data was written and read correctly
  Then: count becomes LENGTH_OF loaded_data
  Then: PRINT count

End:
Return: count
Because: computation complete
