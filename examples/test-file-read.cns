Story: Test file reading functionality

Given:
  test_file: String = "/tmp/test-cns-read.txt"
  file_content: String = ""

Step 1 → Write test file
  Because: Need a file to read
  Effect: Write "Hello from CNS file system!" to /tmp/test-cns-read.txt

Step 2 → Read file back
  Because: Test READ FROM FILE operation
  Then: file_content becomes READ FROM FILE "/tmp/test-cns-read.txt"

Step 3 → Display result
  Because: Verify file was read correctly
  Effect: Print "File content: {file_content}"

End: Return file_content
