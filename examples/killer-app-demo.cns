Story: The CNS Killer App - Multi-API Demo in One Shot
# STARTER - Demonstrates HTTP client, JSON parsing, and zero-dependency API calls

Given:
  api1: String = "http://ip-api.com/json"
  response1: String = ""
  city: String = ""
  country: String = ""
  isp: String = ""
  
  api2: String = "http://httpbin.org/uuid"
  response2: String = ""
  uuid: String = ""

Step 1 → Display header
  Because: Show what we're about to do
  Effect: Print "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
  Effect: Print "  CNS KILLER APP DEMO"
  Effect: Print "  Multi-API Orchestration in Pure CNS"
  Effect: Print "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
  Effect: Print ""

Step 2 → Call first API
  Because: Get geo-location from IP
  Effect: Print "[1/2] Calling IP Geolocation API..."
  Effect: HTTP GET from api1 into response1

Step 3 → Parse location data
  Because: Extract fields from JSON
  Then: city becomes PARSE JSON response1 GET "city"
  Then: country becomes PARSE JSON response1 GET "country"
  Then: isp becomes PARSE JSON response1 GET "isp"
  Effect: Print "     ✓ Location: {city}, {country}"
  Effect: Print "     ✓ ISP: {isp}"
  Effect: Print ""

Step 4 → Call second API
  Because: Generate unique identifier
  Effect: Print "[2/2] Calling UUID Generator API..."
  Effect: HTTP GET from api2 into response2

Step 5 → Parse UUID
  Because: Extract UUID from JSON
  Then: uuid becomes PARSE JSON response2 GET "uuid"
  Effect: Print "     ✓ Generated UUID: {uuid}"
  Effect: Print ""

Step 6 → Show results
  Because: Demonstrate success
  Effect: Print "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
  Effect: Print "  ✅ SUCCESS!"
  Effect: Print ""
  Effect: Print "  • Called 2 different REST APIs"
  Effect: Print "  • Parsed JSON responses"
  Effect: Print "  • Zero dependencies (no pip, npm, cargo)"
  Effect: Print "  • Pure CNS - Just run it!"
  Effect: Print ""
  Effect: Print "  🚀 This would take 100+ lines in Python"
  Effect: Print "  📦 CNS does it in 30 lines with zero setup"
  Effect: Print "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"

End: Return "Demo complete"
  Because: All APIs called successfully
