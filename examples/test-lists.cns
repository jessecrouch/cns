Story: Test list operations

Given:
  todos: List = []
  count: Integer = 0

Step 1 → Add first todo
  Because: Test adding to list
  Effect: ADD "Buy milk" TO LIST todos
  Effect: Print "Added first todo"

Step 2 → Add second todo
  Because: Test adding another item
  Effect: ADD "Write code" TO LIST todos
  Effect: Print "Added second todo"

Step 3 → Check list length
  Because: Verify items were added
  Then: count becomes LENGTH OF todos
  Effect: Print "Todo count: {count}"

Step 4 → Remove an item
  Because: Test removing from list
  Effect: REMOVE "Buy milk" FROM LIST todos

Step 5 → Check length again
  Because: Verify item was removed
  Then: count becomes LENGTH OF todos
  Effect: Print "After removal: {count}"

End: Return count
