Story: Calculate sum of numbers from 1 to n

Given:
  n: Integer = 10
  current: Integer = 1
  sum: Integer = 0

Step 1 → Multiply sum by 1
  Because: initialize the accumulation process
  Then: sum becomes sum + current

Step 2 → If current < n
  Because: more numbers need to be added
  Then: current becomes current + 1

Step 3 → If current < n
  Because: check if we should continue summing
  Then: repeat from Step 1
  Otherwise: go to End

End: Return sum
