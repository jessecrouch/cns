Story: Test Trace with Many Iterations

Given:
  counter: Integer = 25
  result: Integer = 0

Step 1 → Count down from 25
  Because: Test trace mode with many iterations (shows first 10, then every 10th)
  Then: counter becomes counter - 1
  Then: result becomes result + counter
  If: counter > 0
    Then: repeat from Step 1
  Otherwise:
    Then: go to End

End: Return result
  Because: Sum of 0 to 24
