Story: Test Advanced List and Map Operations (v1.9.0)

Given:
  numbers: List = [5, 2, 8, 2, 1, 8, 3]
  words: List = ["zebra", "apple", "mango", "banana"]
  
  reversed: List
  unique: List
  sorted_nums: List
  sorted_words: List
  subset: List
  
  config: Map
  overrides: Map
  merged: Map
  keys: List
  values: List
  
  result: String = ""

Step 1 → Test REVERSE operation
  Because: We need to verify list reversal works correctly
  Then: reversed becomes REVERSE numbers
  Effect: Print "Original: [5, 2, 8, 2, 1, 8, 3]"
  Effect: Print "Reversed: {reversed}"

Step 2 → Test UNIQUE operation
  Because: We need to verify duplicate removal works
  Then: unique becomes UNIQUE numbers
  Effect: Print "Unique: {unique}"

Step 3 → Test SORT on numbers
  Because: We need to verify numeric sorting works
  Then: sorted_nums becomes SORT numbers
  Effect: Print "Sorted numbers: {sorted_nums}"

Step 4 → Test SORT on strings
  Because: We need to verify string sorting works
  Then: sorted_words becomes SORT words
  Effect: Print "Sorted words: {sorted_words}"

Step 5 → Test SLICE operation
  Because: We need to verify list slicing works
  Then: subset becomes SLICE numbers FROM 1 TO 4
  Effect: Print "Slice [1:4]: {subset}"

Step 6 → Create test maps
  Because: We need maps to test map operations
  Effect: SET "host" TO "localhost" IN config
  Effect: SET "port" TO "8080" IN config
  Effect: SET "debug" TO "false" IN config
  Effect: SET "port" TO "3000" IN overrides
  Effect: SET "timeout" TO "30" IN overrides

Step 7 → Test KEYS OF operation
  Because: We need to verify key extraction works
  Then: keys becomes KEYS OF config
  Effect: Print "Config keys: {keys}"

Step 8 → Test VALUES OF operation
  Because: We need to verify value extraction works
  Then: values becomes VALUES OF config
  Effect: Print "Config values: {values}"

Step 9 → Test MERGE operation
  Because: We need to verify map merging works
  Then: merged becomes MERGE config WITH overrides
  Then: keys becomes KEYS OF merged
  Then: values becomes VALUES OF merged
  Effect: Print "Merged keys: {keys}"
  Effect: Print "Merged values: {values}"

Step 10 → Test SORT BY for list of maps
  Because: We need to verify sorting maps by field works
  Effect: Print "All v1.9.0 operations tested successfully!"
  Then: result becomes "PASS"

End: Return result
