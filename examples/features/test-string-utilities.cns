Story: Test String Utilities

Given:
  text: String = "Hello"
  number: String = "42"
  spaces: String = "  trimmed  "
  url: String = "hello world & foo=bar"
  encoded: String = "hello%20world%20%26%20foo%3Dbar"
  messy: String = "!!!Hello World???"
  original: String = "test value: 100%"
  long: String = "HelloWorld"
  already_clean: String = "Clean"
  raw: String = "  test  "

Step 1 → Test PAD RIGHT (default)
  Because: testing PAD operation with right alignment (default)
  Then: padded becomes PAD text TO 10
  Then: PRINT padded
  Then: len1 becomes LENGTH_OF padded
  Then: PRINT len1

Step 2 → Test PAD LEFT
  Because: testing PAD operation with left alignment
  Then: padded_left becomes PAD text TO 10 LEFT
  Then: PRINT padded_left
  Then: len2 becomes LENGTH_OF padded_left
  Then: PRINT len2

Step 3 → Test PAD with custom character
  Because: testing PAD with zero padding
  Then: padded_zero becomes PAD number TO 5 WITH "0"
  Then: PRINT padded_zero
  Then: len3 becomes LENGTH_OF padded_zero
  Then: PRINT len3

Step 4 → Test PAD LEFT with custom character
  Because: testing PAD LEFT with zero padding
  Then: padded_zero_left becomes PAD number TO 5 LEFT WITH "0"
  Then: PRINT padded_zero_left

Step 5 → Test STRIP (both sides - default)
  Because: testing STRIP removes characters from both sides by default
  Then: stripped becomes STRIP " " FROM spaces
  Then: PRINT stripped
  Then: len4 becomes LENGTH_OF stripped
  Then: PRINT len4

Step 6 → Test STRIP LEFT
  Because: testing STRIP LEFT removes characters from left side only
  Then: stripped_left becomes STRIP " " FROM spaces LEFT
  Then: PRINT stripped_left
  Then: len5 becomes LENGTH_OF stripped_left
  Then: PRINT len5

Step 7 → Test STRIP RIGHT
  Because: testing STRIP RIGHT removes characters from right side only
  Then: stripped_right becomes STRIP " " FROM spaces RIGHT
  Then: PRINT stripped_right
  Then: len6 becomes LENGTH_OF stripped_right
  Then: PRINT len6

Step 8 → Test STRIP multiple characters
  Because: testing STRIP with multiple character set
  Then: clean becomes STRIP "!?" FROM messy
  Then: PRINT clean

Step 9 → Test URL_ENCODE
  Because: testing URL_ENCODE operation
  Then: encoded_url becomes URL_ENCODE url
  Then: PRINT encoded_url

Step 10 → Test URL_DECODE
  Because: testing URL_DECODE operation
  Then: decoded_url becomes URL_DECODE encoded
  Then: PRINT decoded_url

Step 11 → Test URL roundtrip
  Because: testing encode then decode returns original
  Then: enc becomes URL_ENCODE original
  Then: dec becomes URL_DECODE enc
  Then: PRINT dec

Step 12 → Test PAD no padding needed
  Because: testing PAD when text is already wide enough
  Then: no_pad becomes PAD long TO 5
  Then: PRINT no_pad
  Then: len7 becomes LENGTH_OF no_pad
  Then: PRINT len7

Step 13 → Test STRIP no characters
  Because: testing STRIP when no characters to strip
  Then: still_clean becomes STRIP " " FROM already_clean
  Then: PRINT still_clean

Step 14 → Test combined operations
  Because: testing chaining string utilities together
  Then: step1 becomes STRIP " " FROM raw
  Then: step2 becomes UPPERCASE step1
  Then: step3 becomes PAD step2 TO 10 LEFT WITH "*"
  Then: PRINT step3

End:
Return: "All string utilities tests passed"
Because: all operations completed successfully
