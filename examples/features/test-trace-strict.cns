Story: Test Trace and Strict Mode

Given:
  counter: Integer = 5
  result: Integer = 0

Step 1 → Count down
  Because: We want to see trace output and test strict mode
  Then: counter becomes counter - 1
  Then: result becomes result + counter
  If: counter > 0
    Then: repeat from Step 1
  Otherwise:
    Then: go to End

End: Return result
  Because: Final result after counting down
