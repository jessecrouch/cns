Story: Test all advanced math functions in CNS

Given:
  number: Integer = 0
  base: Integer = 0
  exponent: Integer = 0
  negative: Integer = 0
  min_val: Integer = 0
  max_val: Integer = 0
  random_val: Integer = 0
  random_range: Integer = 0
  result: Integer = 0

Step 1 → Test SQRT (square root)
  Because: we want to test square root function
  Then: number becomes 16
  Effect: Print "SQRT of 16 = {SQRT OF number}"

Step 2 → Test SQRT with direct value
  Because: test with literal value
  Effect: Print "SQRT of 25 = {SQRT OF 25}"

Step 3 → Test SQRT with 100
  Because: test with larger value
  Then: number becomes 100
  Effect: Print "SQRT of 100 = {SQRT OF number}"

Step 4 → Test POW (exponentiation)
  Because: test power function
  Then: base becomes 2
  Then: exponent becomes 3
  Then: result becomes POW base TO exponent
  Effect: Print "2^3 = {result}"

Step 5 → Test POW with direct values
  Because: test direct power calculation
  Effect: Print "5^2 = {POW 5 TO 2}"

Step 6 → Test POW with larger values
  Because: test larger power
  Effect: Print "10^4 = {POW 10 TO 4}"

Step 7 → Test ABS (absolute value)
  Because: test absolute value with negative
  Then: negative becomes -42
  Effect: Print "ABS of -42 = {ABS OF negative}"

Step 8 → Test ABS with direct negative
  Because: test direct ABS
  Effect: Print "ABS of -100 = {ABS OF -100}"

Step 9 → Test ABS with positive
  Because: test positive ABS
  Then: negative becomes 50
  Effect: Print "ABS of 50 = {ABS OF negative}"

Step 10 → Test ROUND
  Because: test rounding function
  Effect: Print "ROUND 3.7 = {ROUND 3.7}"
  Effect: Print "ROUND 3.2 = {ROUND 3.2}"
  Effect: Print "ROUND 3.5 = {ROUND 3.5}"

Step 11 → Test FLOOR
  Because: test floor function
  Effect: Print "FLOOR 3.9 = {FLOOR 3.9}"
  Effect: Print "FLOOR 3.1 = {FLOOR 3.1}"

Step 12 → Test CEIL
  Because: test ceiling function
  Effect: Print "CEIL 3.1 = {CEIL 3.1}"
  Effect: Print "CEIL 3.9 = {CEIL 3.9}"

Step 13 → Test MIN
  Because: test minimum function
  Then: min_val becomes MIN OF 10 AND 20
  Effect: Print "MIN of 10 and 20 = {min_val}"

Step 14 → Test MIN with different values
  Because: test with reversed values
  Then: min_val becomes MIN OF 100 AND 50
  Effect: Print "MIN of 100 and 50 = {min_val}"

Step 15 → Test MIN with negative
  Because: test with negative values
  Then: min_val becomes MIN OF -5 AND 5
  Effect: Print "MIN of -5 and 5 = {min_val}"

Step 16 → Test MAX
  Because: test maximum function
  Then: max_val becomes MAX OF 10 AND 20
  Effect: Print "MAX of 10 and 20 = {max_val}"

Step 17 → Test MAX with different values
  Because: test with reversed values
  Then: max_val becomes MAX OF 100 AND 50
  Effect: Print "MAX of 100 and 50 = {max_val}"

Step 18 → Test MAX with negative
  Because: test with negative values
  Then: max_val becomes MAX OF -5 AND 5
  Effect: Print "MAX of -5 and 5 = {max_val}"

Step 19 → Test RANDOM float
  Because: test random number generation
  Then: random_val becomes RANDOM
  Effect: Print "RANDOM float (0.0-1.0): {random_val}"

Step 20 → Test RANDOM again
  Because: verify randomness
  Then: random_val becomes RANDOM
  Effect: Print "RANDOM float (0.0-1.0): {random_val}"

Step 21 → Test RANDOM FROM...TO
  Because: test random integer in range
  Then: random_range becomes RANDOM FROM 1 TO 10
  Effect: Print "RANDOM integer (1-10): {random_range}"

Step 22 → Test RANDOM with different range
  Because: test larger range
  Then: random_range becomes RANDOM FROM 100 TO 200
  Effect: Print "RANDOM integer (100-200): {random_range}"

Step 23 → Test dice roll simulation
  Because: simulate a 6-sided die
  Then: random_range becomes RANDOM FROM 1 TO 6
  Effect: Print "Dice roll (1-6): {random_range}"

Step 24 → Test complex math in print
  Because: test combining functions in output
  Then: number becomes 16
  Effect: Print "SQRT OF 16 = {SQRT OF 16}"
  Effect: Print "POW 2 TO 3 = {POW 2 TO 3}"
  Effect: Print "ABS OF -42 = {ABS OF -42}"

End: Return 0
