Story: Test boolean flags with HAS_FLAG function

Given:
  verbose: Boolean = false
  debug: Boolean = false
  quiet: Boolean = false
  unknown: Boolean = false

Step 1 → Check verbose flag
  Because: Determine if --verbose flag was passed
  Then: verbose becomes HAS_FLAG("--verbose")

Step 2 → Display verbose status
  Because: Show the result to user
  If: verbose == true
    Effect: Print "Verbose mode: ENABLED"
  Otherwise:
    Effect: Print "Verbose mode: DISABLED"

Step 3 → Check debug flag
  Because: Determine if --debug flag was passed
  Then: debug becomes HAS_FLAG("--debug")

Step 4 → Display debug status
  Because: Show the result to user
  If: debug == true
    Effect: Print "Debug mode: ENABLED"
  Otherwise:
    Effect: Print "Debug mode: DISABLED"

Step 5 → Check quiet flag
  Because: Determine if --quiet flag was passed
  Then: quiet becomes HAS_FLAG("--quiet")

Step 6 → Display quiet status
  Because: Show the result to user
  If: quiet == true
    Effect: Print "Quiet mode: ENABLED"
  Otherwise:
    Effect: Print "Quiet mode: DISABLED"

Step 7 → Check unknown flag
  Because: Demonstrate behavior when flag not provided
  Then: unknown becomes HAS_FLAG("--unknown")

Step 8 → Display unknown status
  Because: Show the result to user
  If: unknown == true
    Effect: Print "Unknown flag: ENABLED"
  Otherwise:
    Effect: Print "Unknown flag: DISABLED (expected)"

End: Return 0
