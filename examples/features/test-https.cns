Story: Test HTTPS Support
  Narrative: Verify that CNS can make HTTPS requests to secure APIs

Given:
  api_url: String = "https://api.github.com/zen"
  response_body: String = ""
  status: Integer = 0

Step 1 → Make HTTPS GET request to GitHub API
  Because: GitHub API returns a random Zen quote over HTTPS
  Effect: HTTP GET from api_url into response_body
  Then: status becomes 200

Step 2 → Display the response
  Because: We want to see the API response
  Effect: PRINT "GitHub Zen: {response_body}"

End:
  Outcome: Successfully retrieved data via HTTPS
  Return: status
