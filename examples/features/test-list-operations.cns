Story: Test Advanced List Operations (v1.9.0)

Given:
  numbers: List = [5, 2, 8, 2, 1, 8, 3]
  words: List = ["zebra", "apple", "mango", "banana"]
  
  reversed: List
  unique: List
  sorted_nums: List
  sorted_words: List
  subset: List
  
  result: String = ""

Step 1 → Test REVERSE operation
  Because: We need to verify list reversal works correctly
  Then: reversed becomes REVERSE numbers
  Effect: Print "Test 1 - REVERSE: {reversed}"

Step 2 → Test UNIQUE operation
  Because: We need to verify duplicate removal works
  Then: unique becomes UNIQUE numbers
  Effect: Print "Test 2 - UNIQUE: {unique}"

Step 3 → Test SORT on numbers
  Because: We need to verify numeric sorting works
  Then: sorted_nums becomes SORT numbers
  Effect: Print "Test 3 - SORT numbers: {sorted_nums}"

Step 4 → Test SORT on strings
  Because: We need to verify string sorting works
  Then: sorted_words becomes SORT words
  Effect: Print "Test 4 - SORT words: {sorted_words}"

Step 5 → Test SLICE operation
  Because: We need to verify list slicing works
  Then: subset becomes SLICE numbers FROM 1 TO 4
  Effect: Print "Test 5 - SLICE [1:4]: {subset}"

Step 6 → All tests passed
  Because: We completed all list operation tests
  Effect: Print "All v1.9.0 list operations working!"
  Then: result becomes "PASS"

End: Return result
