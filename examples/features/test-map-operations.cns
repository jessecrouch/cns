Story: Test Map Operations (v1.9.0)

Given:
  config: Map
  overrides: Map
  merged: Map
  keys: List
  values: List
  result: String = ""

Step 1 → Create first map
  Because: We need to populate config map
  Effect: CREATE MAP config
  Effect: SET "host" TO "localhost" IN config
  Effect: SET "port" TO "8080" IN config
  Effect: SET "debug" TO "false" IN config

Step 2 → Test KEYS OF operation
  Because: We need to verify key extraction works
  Then: keys becomes KEYS OF config
  Effect: Print "Config keys: {keys}"

Step 3 → Test VALUES OF operation
  Because: We need to verify value extraction works
  Then: values becomes VALUES OF config
  Effect: Print "Config values: {values}"

Step 4 → Create second map
  Because: We need to populate overrides map
  Effect: CREATE MAP overrides
  Effect: SET "port" TO "3000" IN overrides
  Effect: SET "timeout" TO "30" IN overrides

Step 5 → Test MERGE operation
  Because: We need to verify map merging works
  Effect: CREATE MAP merged
  Then: merged becomes MERGE config WITH overrides
  Then: keys becomes KEYS OF merged
  Then: values becomes VALUES OF merged
  Effect: Print "Merged keys: {keys}"
  Effect: Print "Merged values: {values}"
  Then: result becomes "PASS"

End: Return result
