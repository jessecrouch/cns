Story: Test FIND command for file discovery by pattern

Given:
  cns_files: List
  num_cns: Number
  file: String
  lisp_files: List
  num_lisp: Number
  md_files: List
  num_md: Number
  test_files: List
  num_tests: Number
  json_files: List
  num_json: Number

Step 1 → Find all .cns files in examples
  Because: testing basic FIND with pattern matching
  Effect: PRINT "=== Test 1: Find all .cns files ==="
  Effect: FIND "*.cns" IN "examples" INTO cns_files WITH COUNT num_cns
  Effect: PRINT "Found " + num_cns + " .cns files"
  For each file in cns_files:
    Effect: PRINT "  - " + file

Step 2 → Find all .lisp files in src
  Because: testing FIND in different directory
  Effect: PRINT ""
  Effect: PRINT "=== Test 2: Find all .lisp files ==="
  Effect: FIND "*.lisp" IN "src" INTO lisp_files WITH COUNT num_lisp
  Effect: PRINT "Found " + num_lisp + " .lisp files"
  For each file in lisp_files:
    Effect: PRINT "  - " + file

Step 3 → Find all markdown files
  Because: testing FIND from current directory
  Effect: PRINT ""
  Effect: PRINT "=== Test 3: Find all .md files ==="
  Effect: FIND "*.md" IN "." INTO md_files WITH COUNT num_md
  Effect: PRINT "Found " + num_md + " markdown files"
  For each file in md_files:
    Effect: PRINT "  - " + file

Step 4 → Find files matching specific pattern
  Because: testing FIND with complex wildcard
  Effect: PRINT ""
  Effect: PRINT "=== Test 4: Find test-*.cns files ==="
  Effect: FIND "test-*.cns" IN "examples" INTO test_files WITH COUNT num_tests
  Effect: PRINT "Found " + num_tests + " test files"
  For each file in test_files:
    Effect: PRINT "  - " + file

Step 5 → Find JSON files in dataset
  Because: testing FIND in specific subdirectory
  Effect: PRINT ""
  Effect: PRINT "=== Test 5: Find JSON files in dataset ==="
  Effect: FIND "*.json" IN "dataset" INTO json_files WITH COUNT num_json
  Effect: PRINT "Found " + num_json + " JSON files"
  For each file in json_files:
    Effect: PRINT "  - " + file

Step 6 → Complete tests
  Effect: PRINT ""
  Effect: PRINT "=== FIND command tests complete ==="

End:
  Outcome: FIND command successfully discovers files by pattern across directories  
  Return: 0
