Story: Test advanced JSON parsing with nested objects

Given:
  json_data: String = ""
  city: String = ""
  temp: Integer = 0
  status: Integer = 0

Step 1 → Fetch weather data
  Because: Get JSON with nested structure from API
  Effect: HTTP GET from "http://httpbin.org/json" into json_data

Step 2 → Parse nested value
  Because: Extract value from nested JSON
  Then: city becomes PARSE JSON json_data GET "slideshow"
  Effect: Print "Parsed: {city}"

End: Return city
  Because: Return parsed data
