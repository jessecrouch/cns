Story: Test String Operations

Given:
  firstName: String = "John"
  lastName: String = "Doe"
  fullName: String = ""
  nameLength: Integer = 0
  age: Integer = 30
  greeting: String = ""

Step 1 → Concatenate names
  Because: combine first and last name
  Then: fullName becomes firstName + " " + lastName

Step 2 → Get length
  Because: count characters in full name
  Then: nameLength becomes LENGTH OF fullName

Step 3 → Mixed concatenation
  Because: combine string and number
  Then: greeting becomes fullName + " is " + age + " years old"

Step 4 → Display results
  Because: show final output
  Then: Display fullName
  Then: Display nameLength
  Then: Display greeting

End: Return 0
