Story: Test new string operations

Given:
  request: String = "GET /api/users"
  text: String = "hello world test"
  csv: String = "apple,banana,orange"
  starts_result: Boolean
  contains_result: Boolean
  split_result: List

Step 1 → Test STARTS WITH operator
  Because: Need to check if request starts with GET
  Then: starts_result becomes request STARTS WITH "GET"
  Effect: Print "Request starts with GET: {starts_result}"

Step 2 → Test CONTAINS operator
  Because: Need to check if text contains a word
  Then: contains_result becomes text CONTAINS "world"
  Effect: Print "Text contains 'world': {contains_result}"

Step 3 → Test SPLIT operator
  Because: Need to split CSV into list
  Then: split_result becomes SPLIT csv BY ","
  Effect: Print "Split result: {split_result}"

Step 4 → Test STARTS WITH false case
  Because: Verify negative case works
  Then: starts_result becomes request STARTS WITH "POST"
  Effect: Print "Request starts with POST: {starts_result}"

Step 5 → Test CONTAINS false case
  Because: Verify negative case works
  Then: contains_result becomes text CONTAINS "xyz"
  Effect: Print "Text contains 'xyz': {contains_result}"

End: Return "String operations tested"
