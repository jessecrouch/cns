Story: Test String Helper Functions

Given:
  text: String = "  Hello World  "
  messy: String = "the quick brown fox"
  fruits: List = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

Step 1 → Test TRIM
  Because: testing TRIM removes leading/trailing whitespace
  Then: cleaned becomes TRIM text
  Then: PRINT cleaned
  
Step 2 → Test UPPERCASE
  Because: testing UPPERCASE
  Then: upper becomes UPPERCASE cleaned
  Then: PRINT upper

Step 3 → Test LOWERCASE
  Because: testing LOWERCASE
  Then: lower becomes LOWERCASE cleaned
  Then: PRINT lower

Step 4 → Test REPLACE
  Because: testing REPLACE
  Then: replaced becomes REPLACE "World" WITH "CNS" IN cleaned
  Then: PRINT replaced

Step 5 → Test JOIN
  Because: testing JOIN combines list elements
  Then: joined becomes JOIN fruits WITH ", "
  Then: PRINT joined

Step 6 → Test LENGTH_OF string
  Because: testing LENGTH_OF with string
  Then: len1 becomes LENGTH_OF cleaned
  Then: PRINT len1

Step 7 → Test LENGTH_OF list
  Because: testing LENGTH_OF with list
  Then: len2 becomes LENGTH_OF fruits
  Then: PRINT len2

Step 8 → Test multi-word replace
  Because: testing REPLACE with multi-word strings
  Then: result becomes REPLACE "quick brown" WITH "slow red" IN messy
  Then: PRINT result

End:
Return: cleaned
Because: computation complete
