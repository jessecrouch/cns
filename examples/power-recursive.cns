Story: Power (function)
Given:
  base: Integer
  exponent: Integer
  result: Integer = 1

Step 1 → If exponent = 0
  Because: base case
  Then: go to End
  Otherwise: go to Step 2

Step 2 → Recursive calculation
  Because: compute power recursively
  Then: result becomes base * Power(base, exponent - 1)

End: Return result

Story: Test Power
Given:
  answer: Integer = 0

Step 1 → answer becomes Power(2, 3)

End: Return answer
