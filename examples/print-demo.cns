Story: Demonstrate Print effect with variable substitution

Given:
  name: String = "CNS"
  version: Integer = 1
  count: Integer = 42

Step 1 → Print greeting
  Because: we want to show output to the user
  Effect: Print "Hello from {name} version {version}!"

Step 2 → Print the count
  Because: demonstrate variable interpolation
  Effect: Print "The count is: {count}"

End: Return count
