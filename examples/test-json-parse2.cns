Story: Test JSON parsing from file

Given:
  json_file: String = "/tmp/test-json.txt"
  json_data: String = ""
  task_name: String = ""
  task_id: Integer = 0

Step 1 → Read JSON from file
  Because: Load JSON data from file
  Then: json_data becomes READ FROM FILE "/tmp/test-json.txt"
  Effect: Print "JSON loaded: {json_data}"

Step 2 → Parse task name
  Because: Extract name from JSON
  Then: task_name becomes PARSE JSON json_data GET "name"
  Effect: Print "Task name: {task_name}"

Step 3 → Parse task ID
  Because: Extract id from JSON
  Then: task_id becomes PARSE JSON json_data GET "id"
  Effect: Print "Task ID: {task_id}"

End: Return task_name
