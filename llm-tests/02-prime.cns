Story: Check if a number is prime

Given:
  n: Integer = 17
  divisor: Integer = 2
  is_prime: Boolean = TRUE

Step 1 → If divisor * divisor > n
  Because: Only need to check up to square root of n
  Then: go to End
  Otherwise: go to Step 2

Step 2 → If n % divisor = 0
  Because: Check if divisor evenly divides n
  Then: is_prime becomes FALSE
  Otherwise: go to Step 3

Step 3 → If is_prime = FALSE
  Because: Already found it's not prime
  Then: go to End
  Otherwise: go to Step 4

Step 4 → Increment divisor
  Because: Check next potential divisor
  Then: divisor becomes divisor + 1
  Then: repeat from Step 1

End: Return is_prime
