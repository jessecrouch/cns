# CNS Webserver Generation Prompt Template

## System Prompt

You are an expert at writing CNS (Causal Narrative Script) code. CNS is a programming language designed for clarity and explicit reasoning, where every step must explain its purpose with a "Because:" clause.

## CNS Language Rules

### Structure
1. Start with `Story: <description>`
2. Declare all variables in `Given:` section with types and initial values
3. Write steps with `Step N →` followed by action description
4. Every step must have `Because:` explaining the reasoning
5. Use `Effect:` for side effects (I/O, network, etc.)
6. Use `Then:` for state changes
7. Use `If/Then/Otherwise` for conditionals
8. End with `End:` section for cleanup and return value
9. Optional `Error:` section for error handling

### Variable Declaration Format
```
Given:
  <name>: <Type> [<semantic-tag>] = <value>
```

Example:
```
Given:
  port: Integer [network port] = 8080
  socket: Socket [network listener]
  count: Integer [connection counter] = 0
```

### Step Format
```
Step N → <action description>
  Because: <reasoning>
  Effect: <side effect>  (optional)
  Then: <state change>   (optional)
```

### Conditional Format
```
Step N → If <condition>
  Then: <action if true>
  Otherwise: <action if false>
  Because: <reasoning>
```

### Available Types
- Integer: Whole numbers
- String: Text in quotes
- List: Arrays like [1, 2, 3]
- Socket: Network connection
- Object: Complex data structures

### String Operations
- `text STARTS WITH "prefix"` - Returns T if text starts with prefix, NIL otherwise
- `text CONTAINS "substring"` - Returns T if text contains substring, NIL otherwise
- `SPLIT text BY ","` - Splits text into list using delimiter

Example:
```
Step 5 → Parse request method
  Then: is_get becomes request STARTS WITH "GET"
  Then: has_json becomes request CONTAINS "application/json"
  Then: parts becomes SPLIT request BY "\n"
  Because: Extract request information using string operations
```

### Available Effects
- `Print "<message>"` - Output with {var} interpolation
- `Write "<content>" to <file>` - File writing
- `Append "<content>" to <file>` - File appending
- `Create socket <name> on <port>` - Socket creation
- `Accept connection` - Wait for client
- `Send "<data>" to <target>` - Network send
- `Network read` - Read from network
- `Network write` - Write to network
- `Close socket <name>` - Socket cleanup
- `Log "<message>"` - Error logging

### Control Flow
- `repeat from Step N` - Loop back
- `go to Step N` - Jump forward
- `go to End` - Exit early

## Generation Task

Given this task: **{TASK}**

Generate complete CNS code that:
1. Defines a clear Story describing the goal
2. Declares all necessary variables in Given section
3. Implements the logic in numbered Steps
4. Includes Because clauses for every step
5. Uses appropriate Effects for I/O operations
6. Handles errors with an Error block
7. Ends with proper cleanup

## Example 1: Simple Webserver

Task: "Create a webserver on port 8080 that responds with 'Hello, World!'"

```cns
Story: Run a simple webserver on port 8080

Given:
  port: Integer [network port] = 8080
  server_socket: Socket [network listener]
  response: String = "Hello, World!" [default response]
  connection_count: Integer = 0 [track connections]
  
Step 1 → Create server_socket on port
  Effect: Create socket server_socket on 8080
  Because: We need to listen for incoming HTTP connections
  
Step 2 → Accept connection on server_socket
  Effect: Accept connection
  Because: Wait for client request
  Then: connection_count becomes connection_count + 1
  
Step 3 → Parse HTTP request
  Effect: Network read from client_stream into request_data
  Because: Receive and understand client's HTTP request
  
Step 4 → Send response to client
  Effect: Send "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\n{response}" to client
  Because: Return the greeting to the client
  
Step 5 → If connection_count < 3
  Then: repeat from Step 2
  Otherwise: go to End
  Because: Handle up to 3 connections for this demo
  
Error:
  Return "Server error"
  Effect: Log "Error in webserver"
  Because: Handle unexpected failures gracefully
  
End: Close server_socket
  Effect: Close socket server_socket
  Because: Clean up network resources properly
```

## Example 2: Webserver with Routing

Task: "Create a webserver with /hello and /goodbye routes"

```cns
Story: Webserver with multiple routes using string operations

Given:
  port: Integer = 8080
  server_socket: Socket
  request_data: String
  response: String
  is_hello: String
  is_goodbye: String
  
Step 1 → Create server_socket on port
  Effect: Create socket server_socket on port
  Because: Need to listen for incoming HTTP connections
  
Step 2 → Accept connection on server_socket
  Effect: Accept connection on server_socket
  Because: Handle incoming HTTP request
  
Step 3 → Read request from client
  Effect: Network read from client_stream into request_data
  Because: Receive HTTP request data
  
Step 4 → Check if request is for /hello route
  Then: is_hello becomes request_data STARTS WITH "GET /hello"
  Because: Determine if client wants hello greeting
  
Step 5 → Check if request is for /goodbye route
  Then: is_goodbye becomes request_data STARTS WITH "GET /goodbye"
  Because: Determine if client wants goodbye message
  
Step 6 → If is_hello = T
  Then: response becomes "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\nHello, World!"
  Otherwise: go to Step 7
  Because: Respond to hello route
  
Step 7 → If is_goodbye = T
  Then: response becomes "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\nGoodbye, World!"
  Otherwise: go to Step 8
  Because: Respond to goodbye route
  
Step 8 → If response = ""
  Then: response becomes "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\nRoute not found"
  Because: No route matched, return 404
  
Step 9 → Send response to client
  Effect: Send response to client
  Because: Return HTTP response
  
Step 10 → Repeat from Step 2
  Because: Continue serving requests
  
End: Return "Server stopped"
  Effect: Close socket server_socket
  Because: Clean up network resources
```
